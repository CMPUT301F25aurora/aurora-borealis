## Project Description 

AuroraChance is a mobile application designed to streamline event registration and participant selection through a transparent, lottery-based system. Built for both organizers and entrants, it simplifies event management, random draws, and participant tracking within an intuitive Android interface.

## Key-Features
- Smart Pooling System: Automatically manage event interest by pulling selected entrants from a live waiting list. Organizers can run lotteries or manually choose participants with ease.
  
- QR Code Event Access: Entrants can instantly access event pages by scanning a QR code — view details, join waiting lists, and stay connected without manual searching.
  
- Real-Time Firebase Sync: All event data, attendee updates, notifications, and check-ins stay synced across devices in real time through Firebase integration.
  
- Role-Based User Experience: Entrants, Organizers, and Admins each get a tailored interface and permissions designed specifically for their role within the app.

- Event Poster Uploads: Organizers can upload custom event posters to make their event pages more engaging and visually distinct.
  
- Optional Geolocation Verification: When enabled by organizers, entrants’ join locations are captured from the device to verify authenticity and support location-based event rules.

- Dedicated Organizer Map Console: A specialized map interface available exclusively to event creators. Organizers can set, validate, and manage precise event coordinates using an integrated place-picker, ensuring accurate location data for geolocation rules and event logistics.
